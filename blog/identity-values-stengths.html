      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now

      In my previous Retail life, I was met a couple times with situations where
      ethics vs. business policy (in some cases retail law) came about. Most of
      these times occured when customers were wanting to return an item. Now
      bluntly, returning an item due to change of mind generally isn't an
      accepted reason for return. This was the decision that had to be made
      almost everytime. The one time I didn't go this way and actually gave the
      return was because of the situation the customer had found themselves in.
      This has got nothing to do with our policy but I made the decision because
      it was the right thing to do and Integrity to me is everything. The
      customer was genuine and the product was un-opened and a popular item that
      we could have easily resold (which we did later that week). I got a slight
      repremand from my boss for not follwing policy, but he had to say that in
      order to "tell me off". He too would have done the same thing so I've
      never felt that this was incorrect, even if my boss didn't agree, I still
      would stand by what I did

      I come from a rather large family (I have 7 siblings) and alot of them
      live locally. My parental dynamic saw my mum raise us the most whilst
      working and dad doing long hours with the truck driving - he'd leave very
      early in the morning and not get in until after we'd be alseep. We spent
      alot of time at my grandparents (mums parents) house and this would be
      where alot of old school lessons were taught. Mum had somewhat of a
      christian upbringing and this has influenced alot of how I am today too.
      Whilst not religious, I'm greatful for being taught these kinds of
      lessons. Being Maori and Niuean has also influenced me massively. Biggest
      lesson I learnt here was to give, even when you can't and not placing too
      much value on material things
