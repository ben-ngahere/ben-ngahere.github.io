    <h3 class="subtitle">A time I was Blocked on a Simple Problem</h3>
    <p>
      The Challenge:
      <em
        >using <strong>.join</strong> to take individual strings from an array
        and return one string
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I confidently jumped into this one as I had previously researched this and
      had used it in one of our previous exercises. So here I go happily writing
      the code and to my surprise the test fails. Hmm. Ok. I check the spelling
      of the parameter. No problems. I check the right brackets were used. No
      problems either. At this point I'm starting to scratch my head, so I did
      what most would do...I deleted it and started again
    </p>
    <p>
      This time when I wrote the code I changed the names of the parameters
      (thinking that this would actually change the outcome haha) but the same
      red fail message came up. I also realised at this point, I hadn't had a
      break in a while so did that and when I came back it dawned on me to maybe
      check what the fail message says and check the test file and boom! I had
      put a
      <strong>space</strong> in between the quote marks when the test required
      no space...sheesh
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a bit frustrated that it was simple but then started to laugh
      because it was so simple! What I learnt here was that I just needed to
      slow down and realise that there's help around (in this case it was in the
      form of the error message and test file) and to actually use the help
      that's available
    </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">A Time I Elegantly Solved a Problem</h3>
    <p>
      The Challenge:
      <em><strong>superFlipFlop</strong> </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This one gave me a lot of satisfaction as it had a
      <strong>Loop</strong> element to it and I had put a lot of time into
      understanding them and how to write the code. Which of course at first
      there were many iterations of is <em>i greater than or less than</em> and
      making sure all 3 types of brackets were in the right places
    </p>
    <p>
      It took a few goes and it passed the test. Yay! Great! But looking at my
      code, it seemed like I was doing 1 or 2 steps too many so dove into trying
      to refactor it
    </p>
    <p>
      During this step, I found that I'd actually defined an extra
      <strong>Object</strong> that was doing nothing as I never used it during
      the <strong>For Loop</strong>, so got rid of that. I also went back over
      <strong>Dot Notation</strong> and changed the loops output to one line
      instead of defining a variable to equal the output and then using that
      variable to be pushed into the empty array

      How Confident I feel Using These Problem-Solving Techniques/Processes
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Psuedocode: </strong> I've been trying to incorporate more of
        this into my coding from last week and it's getting better. I need to
        remember to do this first and then code as I tend to do it in reverse
      </li>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Trying Something: </strong> I tend to hang around in this space
        a lot. I'm happy trying out solutions and learning from each attempt
      </li>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Rubber Ducky Method: </strong>Haven't really used this one. Will
        go back to refresh and see if it'll help next time i'm stuck
      </li>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Console.logging: </strong>Pretty happy using console.log. Have
        used it since it was introduced and continue to use it
      </li>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Googling: </strong>#1 go to when I want to know anything
      </li>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Asking Your Peers for Help: </strong>Will try to. I have this
        thing where I think that they're learning too so should just let them
        be, but should just say something
      </li>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Asking Your Coaches for Help: </strong>Have come very close,
        haven't as of yet, but it's coming
      </li>
      <li class="p">
        <strong>Improving Your Process with Reflection: </strong>Something I've
        started doing since Reflections and it's been quite good. I reflect
        mainly on what was done in the day and what I learnt and what it means
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="subtitle">A Time I was Reluctant to ask for Help</h3>
    <p>
      Naturally, I find it hard to ask for help at the best of times. I enjoy
      the challenge of not knowing and using what little knowledge I have of
      something to figure it out...but there's always a time when you do need
      help and that time was earlier this week
    </p>
    <p>
      I was trying to do my best and work my way through the JS Kata exercises,
      but I did need to reach out to a colleague of mine to help with the
      understanding of Object Manipulation. All of the Googling and Tutorials
      couldn't help me to understand the how, what and why, so I gave in and
      phoned a friend
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving the help I needed, turns out I just need someone to
      explain it to me like i'm 5, I was away and finished the exercise with
      minimal fuss. The lesson here is to not be afraid and to not be so proud
      to not ask for help
