    <h1 class="title">JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      In this blog we'll discuss some JavaScript (JS) basics, how it fits in
      with Web Development and it's relationship between HTML and CSS
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      JavaScript, HTML and CSS - How are these 3 related?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Let's say you've been tasked with building a car. There are many parts to
      a car and it'd be hard to know where to start. Thankfully, you have a
      blueprint to work off of that helps you define the cars size, shape, how
      many seats, wheels and doors there will be. This blueprint is like HTML.
      Now, we know that the car isn't finished just because we've managed this
      part, it needs the actual seats and windows and doors and of course what
      type and color of paint will be used. Making the car look like a car can
      be likened to CSS. Now that we have all of this, our car is ready yeah?
      Not quite! Where's its Engine? Transmission? Other mechanical and
      electrical parts that make the car move, stop, speed-up/slow-down? That's
      where JavaScript comes into play.
    </p>

    <p>
      In essence, HTML lays out the structure, CSS makes it more visually
      appealing and JavaScript enables interactivity

    <h3 class="subtitle">Control Flow and Loops</h3>
    <p>
      Control Flow is the way in which the code is read. HTML and CSS read from
      top to bottom and can sometimes overwrite earlier instructions due to
      this. For JS, we don't really want this to happen, well not all the time
      at least. Thankfully we have Conditionals and Loops to help us out with
      this!
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting a Condition lets us provide a Function for it. Dependent on the
      function, it can make the condition true or false immediately or when
      another condition has been met
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting a Loop allows an action to repeat however many times you've set it
      to and/or until a condition is met. Typically this type of code is used
      with Arrays as it can take one of the many values set within one and
      return it with another one
    </p>
    <img id="image" src="/images/loop.png" />
    <p>
      <em
        >Counter (i) starts at 0, if this number (i) is less than 5, add one and
        keep counting until 5</em
      >
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">Arrays and Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Arrays (set within [] brackets) can hold multiple values and these values
      can be called depending on their position within the array and what ever
      condition has been set in order for this to happen. Positions? See the
      image below to see what is meant by this. Arrays start counting from 0...
      (programmer things xD)
    </p>
    <img id="image" src="/images/Array.png" />
    <p>
      Objects contain Variables defined by Keys and the Value given to them.
      Using this kind of code can help with assigning lots of Values to a single
      Variable. That way you don't have to code the same value every time,
      instead you can just call that info from the Object Key. You can use that
      same info for other functions too
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">Functions</h3>
    <p>
      Functions perform a particular task and are really useful as you can reuse
      the same code however many times is required meaning you don't have to
      continually code the same lines, just call it
    </p>

    <p>
      <em
        >This function is rendering the words "Cash:$' and the dollar value (set
        by the variable cash) and is putting it in place of the 'cash' ID that
        has been set in HTML (bit of DOM manipulation going on...more on that
        below)</em

    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">What is DOM?</h3>
    <p>
      Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows
      JavaScript to interact and manipulate a web pages content, structure and
      style. DevTools in Chrome is a type of DOM and it can represent a document
      (HTML, CSS or JS) as a node, which is how programming languages can
      interact with the page
    </p>
    <p>
      Some typical use cases of the DOM include; building interactive elements
      like buttons, forms and animations that respond to actions, as well as
      dynamic updates, being able to update a part of a website without a
      full-reload
