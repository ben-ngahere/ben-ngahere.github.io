    <h3 class="subtitle">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      My long term goal is get into a remote back-end Web Development position.
      At the end of this programme, I want to be able to approach a junior web
      dev position and confidently apply for it (even without the overall
      experience)

      Strengths and Limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      I'm a natural problem solver and enjoy challenges. I feel this will me
      along my learning journey and beyond. I also good with sticking things out
      and being persistent. These two strengths have help me achieve some good
      things both personally and in my career before now. One limitation for me
      is attention span as there's many things at home where I study currently
      and is easy to start doing other things besides what I'm spposed to be
      doing (mostly making and eating food). If I find things to be boring, I
      also tend to get distracted easily
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      I'd like to see myself be a bit more open to the course and being online.
      I've been reasonably reserved, but as we progress thorugh the sprints and
      beyond, I'm wanting to contribute more to the group. My personal online
      social presence is very limited as it is, so this will be a big move for
      me. Even doing these blogs and having them somewhat public is somewhat
      daunting
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
    </h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      I have a set schedule for study and my own time and will stick to this
      religiously. I'm the kind of person who needs this structure else i'd
      flounder without it. I've been able to work with many different people
      over the years, so working together with others is no problem. We're also
      here to better ourselves so we should encourage each other to do our best
      and keep getting back up and carrying on when it gets tough, as well as
      lend a helping hand. When things are getting tough, I need to speak up. I
      have a bad habbit of not asking for help and just tend to dig deep in
      order to get things done (not always the best thing to do). I'll know
      ahead of time if i'm unable to achieve a task, so I really need to ask for
      help then and not at the end of the week or sprint
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      To walk the talk. Help when required, but not give the answer. Be
      available throughout the study hours and to provide feedback. Keep being
      awesome humans you all have been so far!
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Any scheduling information?</h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      At the moment I only have a few pick-up and drop-offs for my daughter to
      school and back, but other than that I have no other commitments that will
      impede my study-time. I do have a casual contract with one of my previous
      employers, but I have control over how that can look so i'm only commited
      to that when I say I can be
