      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now
    </h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      In my previous Retail life, I was met a couple times with situations where
      ethics vs. business policy (in some cases retail law) came about. Most of
      these times occured when customers were wanting to return an item. Now
      bluntly, returning an item due to change of mind generally isn't an
      accepted reason for return. This was the decision that had to be made
      almost everytime. The one time I didn't go this way and actually gave the
      return was because of the situation the customer had found themselves in.
      This has got nothing to do with our policy but I made the decision because
      it was the right thing to do and Integrity to me is everything. The
      customer was genuine and the product was un-opened and a popular item that
      we could have easily resold (which we did later that week). I got a slight
      repremand from my boss for not follwing policy, but he had to say that in
      order to "tell me off". He too would have done the same thing so I've
      never felt that this was incorrect, even if my boss didn't agree, I still
      would stand by what I did

      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity

      I come from a rather large family (I have 7 siblings) and alot of them
      live locally. My parental dynamic saw my mum raise us the most whilst
      working and dad doing long hours with the truck driving - he'd leave very
      early in the morning and not get in until after we'd be alseep. We spent
      alot of time at my grandparents (mums parents) house and this would be
      where alot of old school lessons were taught. Mum had somewhat of a
      christian upbringing and this has influenced alot of how I am today too.
      Whilst not religious, I'm greatful for being taught these kinds of
      lessons. Being Maori and Niuean has also influenced me massively. Biggest
      lesson I learnt here was to give, even when you can't and not placing too
      much value on material things

      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey
    </h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      I'm good with puzzles and enjoy the challenge it brings. This is similar
      for me with coding and problem solving so I think this will help me to
      stay interested and want to continue to learn. I also get very dedicated
      once I've found something I want to do. I stay persistant (maybe
      borderline obessive?) until I achieve what I've set to do. Having tested
      these strengths over the years I've spent in Retail will allow me to
      create a learning plan that I know I'll adhere to
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p class="parafix">
      Trying to learn too much or going too deep into a topic is where I can
      fall over. Especially with this "flipped-classroom" model this course has
      been designed around. I need to sty aware of this so that I don't feel
      unsatisfied with what I achieve. I also tend to get impatient with
      learning, more so if i'm not getting it as fast as I think I should be.
      It's ok that I'm not good at this and will get better with practice
    </p>

      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why

      There were 5 of us put into a group to merchandise an area for a sale we
      were about to have. Lots of product to move and display as well as setup
      the counter and a way for people to pay. At first we each decided what we
      wanted to do and away we went. About 30mins into working, 2 of the team
      members were stuck on how to do something, they sought help and proceeded
      to carry on. 10mins later they're stuck again and the person who helped
      them last time wasn't available. The rest of us tried to pitch in and help
      but none of us were able to really get them to understand, so they
      floundered for another 10mins before deciding they can't do it and would
      leave. After trying to help them again, I asked them if they actually
      wanted to do the task they were set. No was their answer, so team members
      eneded up swapping jobs, funnliy they swapped to what they wanted to do
      and all went well in the end. Instead of letting it be or allowing us to
      choose the jobs would be something I'd change next time. Utilising
      strenghts and willingness to achieve a goal is what I learnt that day
