      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Use it and Improve it</li>
      <p>
        Neural paths grow stronger the more they are used. To me and my coding
        it means getting better at what I already know. This could be practicing
        the code, reading and talking to others about their code and learning
        new code to improve existing knowledge
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Time Matters</li>
      <p>
        It takes time dependent on how complex the new behavior/skill is. To me
        this rings true and is one of the hardest things to want to recognise
        and be patient with. Whilst wanting to "know it all", learning coding is
        hard (if it were easy, we'd all be doing it) and recognising that it
        takes time will help you feel better about the progress that's made,
        which makes you keep going
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Repetition Matters</li>
      <p>
        Consistency is the key to building new pathways. Practice makes
        permanent. Like learning anything, practice, practice and practice is
        required. There's really no two ways about it and for me, recognising
        this gives me motivation to want to do it more. It doesn't have to be
        for the longest time, just consistent. Eg. 30mins everyday Vs. 3hrs one
        day a week - the same amount of total time is taken, but you've engaged
        7 times versus the 1 time. 7 small wins versus 1 big win. Consistently
        achieving multiple small wins often leads to more sustained progress and
        motivation
      </p>

What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the
Human Skills learning? What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness
in learning and programming? What has surprised you the most about the Human
Skills learning? What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
learning? Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course? Does the
time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time?
Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify
your answer.
