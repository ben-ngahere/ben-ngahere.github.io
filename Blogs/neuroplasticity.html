      How understanding the Principles of Neuroplasticity benefits people?
    </h3>
    <p>
      A popular belief is that there are 10 principles of neuroplasticity
      <a
        class="aa"
        href="https://www.re-origin.com/articles/top-10-principles-of-neuroplasticity"
        target="_blank"
        >[Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, Jeffrey A. Kleim
        and Theresa A. Jones]</a
      >
      Understanding these principles helps benefit people by recognising that
      there are specific things that can be done to improve intelligence or
      improved cognitive ability. Once this is recognised, people are able to
      take control as they no longer feel it's a "natural-only" thing. This
      leads to believing in ones self and the start of a growth mindset
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">How would I engage with the Principles?</h3>
    <p>Of the 10 recognised principles, there are 3 that resonate with me</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Use it and Improve it</li>
      <p>
        Neural paths grow stronger the more they are used. To me and my coding
        it means getting better at what I already know. This could be practicing
        the code, reading and talking to others about their code and learning
        new code to improve existing knowledge
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Time Matters</li>
      <p>
        It takes time dependent on how complex the new behavior/skill is. To me
        this rings true and is one of the hardest things to want to recognise
        and be patient with. Whilst wanting to "know it all", learning coding is
        hard (if it were easy, we'd all be doing it) and recognising that it
        takes time will help you feel better about the progress that's made,
        which makes you keep going
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Repetition Matters</li>
      <p>
        Consistency is the key to building new pathways. Practice makes
        permanent. Like learning anything, practice, practice and practice is
        required. There's really no two ways about it and for me, recognising
        this gives me motivation to want to do it more. It doesn't have to be
        for the longest time, just consistent. Eg. 30mins everyday Vs. 3hrs one
        day a week - the same amount of total time is taken, but you've engaged
        7 times versus the 1 time. 7 small wins versus 1 big win. Consistently
        achieving multiple small wins often leads to more sustained progress and
        motivation
      </p>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">What are some ways to increase Neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      Research brings back many ways to do this, but I'm fond of a few of these
      ways for me to
      <a
        class="aa"
        href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain"
        target="_blank"
        >increase my neuroplasticity</a
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Play Video Games</li>
      <p>
        I do this anyway (as many of us do!) and I'm a big believer that games
        (not all, but majority) are great for increasing problem-solving,
        memory, hand-eye and visuospatial co-ordination, reasoning, co-operation
        and decision making to name a few. There is a difference from using it
        as a tool to improve cognitive ability versus just playing, so keep that
        in mind
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Travel</li>
      <p>
        This helps with cognitive flexibility, inspiration and creativity.
        Experiencing new places and cultures can and has helped me to become a
        better communicator and broaden my view on the world and life, which has
        given me different perspectives for either personal growth (goals,
        relationships etc) and values
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Learn a new Language</li>
      <p>
        Arguably doing this right now. There's research to suggest that by doing
        this, it increases your brain matter. Increased brain matter helps
        improve attention, memory and emotions which in turn allows for better
        problem-solving, increased comprehension and an improved ability to
        multitask
      </p>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="heading">Growth Mindset</h1>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">What is it? Why is it Relevant?</h3>
    <p>
      A
      <a
        class="aa"
        href="https://theeducationhub.org.nz/an-introduction-to-growth-mindset-2/"
        target="_blank"
        >Growth Mindset</a
      >
      is believing abilities can be developed through effort. It fosters a love
      for learning and empowers people to control their development. It's
      relevant because, as students, it allows us to realise that what we are
      learning can in fact be learnt and that it's ok if you don't get things
      right away as this type of mindset will make you persevere at the problem.
      This is an important state of mind for a coder to have as problem-solving
      will be a daily occurrence in the workplace. Having this type of mindset
      is conducive to success personally and professionally
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">Did anything Surprise or Change me?</h3>
    <p>
      Not particularly, only because I'm familiar with this concept (previous
      employment PD courses) and believe it. Essentially what I was able to
      achieve in previous lives is all due to having a Growth Mindset and
      embracing the understanding of Neuroplasticity. Even now, choosing to come
      to Dev Academy in order to pursue a new career came from a Growth Mindset
      and for me to be successful, it will continue to
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      How will I integrate this with my Learning Journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The way I'm using Growth Mindset in my learning journey is mentally
      backing myself (we are our own biggest blocks to becoming better).
      Understanding that there are going to be challenges and going into those
      knowing I can ask for help and to preserver when it gets tough as I
      believe the results of effort will pay off. Remembering that all
      challenges are opportunities for growth. "If you think you can or you
      think you can't, you're right"
