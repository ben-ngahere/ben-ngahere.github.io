    <h1 class="heading">CSS: Classes Vs. Ids</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      In CSS, when using "Classes" and "Id" selectors, they help to keep your
      code organised, efficient and keep the same design elements throughout
      when working with HTML. Below I will explain the differences and best
      practices on when to use a Class or an ID
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">What is an ID?</h3>
    <p>
      An ID identifies a single element, which lets us apply a particular style
      to it. IDs are specific. There can be multiple elements on a page, but the
      ID marks a specific element. Each element can only have one ID, and each
      page can only have one element with that specific ID. When classifying an
      ID, see the images on how to set the ID in HTML and then how to use it
      with CSS (the # is important when declaring in CSS)
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="/Images/ID-1.png" />
      <br />
      <img src="/Images/ID-2.png" />
      <br />
    </div>
    <h3 class="subtitle">What is a Class?</h3>
    <p>
      A Class identifies multiple elements and should be used when we need to
      use the same selector many times within the page or site. Classes can be
      assigned to multiple elements and is the main difference from an ID as
      they are not unique. EG. only 1 element can have an ID, but it can have
      multiple classes (the . is important when declaring in CSS)
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="/Images/Class-1.png" />
      <img src="/Images/Class-2.png" />
      <br />
    </div>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Best Practices</h3>
    <p>
      At first it can be hard to know which one to use and using one or the
      other isn't really wrong as they both kind of do the same thing. The main
      thing to think of is like this; A class is like a barcode and an ID is
      like a serial number. Use a Class to identify multiple of the same thing
      eg. the model of a cellphone. Use an ID to identify the specific one of
      all the same models
