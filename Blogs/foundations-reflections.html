      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Perseverance</li>
      <p>
        I thought I had this down. There's been a few times in my life where
        this has had to take the front seat, so am used to it. But during Sprint
        4 it was tested. I don't think I've been challenged mentally like that,
        so my Perseverance got redefined
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Time Management</li>
      <p>
        Now this hasn't been a train-wreck or anything crazy, but I had noticed
        I started moving away from timers. Not sure if I need to get back on it,
        but I've started to manage my time based on dividing the total workload
        over what I think I can do it in? For me it's more intuitive to do it
        like this. I will be keeping an eye on it as it may not be conducive
        moving forward
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Communication</li>
      <p>
        This has changed a lot for me. Coming from my immediate background,
        there'd be multiple colleagues and customers everyday and communication
        was always on in full (tone, body language etc.) The last 5 weeks makes
        me feel like I haven't communicated at all, even though I have. Almost
        feel out of place with it, like I don't know how to anymore. An
        adjustment is in progress
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      What are the roles of Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness in Learning and
      Programming?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Values</li>
      <p>
        They act as principles that shape our Motivations, Decisions, and how we
        Approach tasks. They help to improve our Perseverance and Resilience
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Empathy</li>
      <p>
        An ability to Understand and share the Feelings of others, is
        surprisingly important to Learning and Programming. It helps to better
        our Communication, enhancing Collaboration resulting in improved
        Environments
      </p>
      <li class="bullet">Self-Awareness</li>
      <p>
        An ability to Understand our own Emotions, Strengths & Weaknesses and
        their impact on others is Fundamental. It allows us to manage our
        Emotions, helping to relieve Stress and be more Adaptable
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      How relevant the skills really are in life in general. I don't think there
      are many situations, both personal and professional, where these skills
      wouldn't be of benefit
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Letting my guard down a little and talking about myself. Definitely not a
      conversation starter I keep up my sleeve. I've always found that difficult
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      Why do you think we, a Programming School, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a Web Development BootCamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think it's because they go hand-in-hand with each other. Coding skills
      are great and all, but if you can't communicate and work with another
      person or group, then that's an awkward time for everyone. I believe that
      these skills were also lacking in the Tech Industry, so they're necessary
      to make us more employable and be better Developers and Humans in general
    </p>
    <h3 class="subtitle">
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
      instead?
    </h3>
    <p>
      No not really. Sure my coding skills definitely need practice, but without
      the Human Skills, that practice will only get me so far. To me it's like
      that saying "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go
      together"
