    <h3 class="subtitle">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
      A number of sources define EQ as being an ability to understand ones and
      others emotions as well as manage ones own. People capable of doing this
      are able to communicate well, build and maintain relationships easily and
      proceed through challenges. For a web developer, this ability has its
      merits when working in a team as well as the many challenges we'll come
      across. It also extends into our personal lives allowing us to become
      happier about ourselves and be more self-aware of how we are in the world
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      EQ (Emotional Quotient) is a measure of your ability to understand and
      manage emotions, empathy towards others and relationship building. IQ
      (Intelligence Quotient) is a measure of of your ability to problem-solve
      as well as analytical and logical reasoning skills. Both measure different
      things, but both are required to be successful in almost any situation.
      You can liken this to "Book-Smart" Vs. "Street-Smart" and how a
      combination of both are required
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3 class="subtitle">Why is EQ important?</h3>
    <p>
      There are quite a number of benefits that can occur both personally and
      professionally from people who have high EQ or are working towards
      improving their EQ. Some of these include; - Improved relationships -
      Increased resilience - Better communication - Better teamwork - Improved
      conflict resolution There are a few more, but essentially there's next to
      no downsides to being emotionally intelligent. It benefits yourself as
      well as others which only equates to success
